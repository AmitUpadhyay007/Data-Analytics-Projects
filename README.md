MySQL Data Cleaning Project - Layoffs Dataset
This repository contains a MySQL-based data cleaning project where I applied various data cleaning techniques to the Layoffs Dataset. The project demonstrates practical steps for cleaning and preparing data for analysis. The following operations were performed:

Removed Duplicates: Identified and removed duplicate records to ensure data consistency.
Standardized Data: Applied transformations to standardize data formats, such as date formats and text cases.
Null/Blank Value Treatment: Handled missing or blank values through appropriate imputation techniques or removal based on the dataset's context.
Removed Useless Rows/Columns: Filtered out irrelevant or redundant columns and rows to improve data quality and relevance.
The repository includes:

The Layoffs Dataset used for this project.
The MySQL script with all the queries and transformations applied during the cleaning process.
